The project's goal is to secure the files using hybrid cryptography. Such applications are used in banking applications and systems to protect information and data sets. 

You can encrypt the files with Blowfish because it is accurate and fast. Use symmetric algorithms for decryption. Even in remote servers, the hybrid technique can provide exceptional cloud security. With this project, you can add data security to your skill set, which is in high demand due to the increased frequency of security risks and attacks. Cryptography will be used to convert the data sets into unreadable forms.
